1) What is Java inheritance?
    subclass have access to members of its super class

2) How does inheritance work?
    See 1

3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?
    not needing to rewrite logic (this is huge)

4) What does the "super" keyword do?
    refers to the super class' members

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?
    from the top!

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?
    that's there's a different implementation in a subclass that will be called instead

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?
    the super class has method x, but the subclass can have the same method with a different implementation

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?
    overloaded are different implementations of the same method within the same class

9) What is dynamic method dispatch?
    when a method is decided upon at runtime based on the type of object that's calling.
    it's dynamic because the jvm binds objects at runtime instead of compiletime. So a object that changes
    type and calls a method will call the method of the type it is, potentially overriding it's original type's method

10) What does the "final" keyword do?
    makes variables unchangeable, methods un-override-able, makes classes un-inheritable

11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?
    the object class
