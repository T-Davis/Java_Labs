 * 2. try is kind of like an if statement, if this works (try this) move on, if not catch exception
 * 3. your not calling try
 * 4. your program stops and you get the default error handling by the jvm
 * 5. the super class will catch all the exceptions, no need for the second catch. Call b first, you want to catch
 *      exceptions closest to where it happened
 * 6. yes
 * 7. finally is what is executed at the end of a try block
 * 8. everything except runtime and error
 * 9. does not extend throwable
 * 10. later
 * 11. error in jvm, your code, or throw statement
 * 12. error and exception
 * 13. can catch multiple exceptions
