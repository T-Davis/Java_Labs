Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
    a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
    String[] cats = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
    array of arrays

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
    int[][] scores = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
    String dog10 = dogs[9];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
    when you're referencing outside of an array

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
    int test = intArray[intArray.length - 2]

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
    lots, essentially max size of int

9) What is a bubble sort?
    a super slow way to sort data. iterates through each set of elements for every element

10) How does a bubble sort work?
    compares each element to the element before it, and switches them depending on the parameters

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
    when you have an array of data that stores other arrays of data of variable elements

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
    for (int x: nums) System.out.print(x + " ");

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
    while(int x != nums.length - 1] print...

14) What is a queue?
    fifo list of elements

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
    put() and get()

16) What is a stack?
    filo list of elements

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
    fifo vs filo

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
    when you are iterating through a data structure and don't need the iterator count
    data structure must be a part of the java collections framework

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
    set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structures. Although referred to as
    a framework, it works in a manner of a library. The JCF provides both interfaces that define various collections
    and classes that implement them

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
    for (int x = 0; x < nums.length; x++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums[x].length; i++); {
        }
    }

21) What is a String?
    a class that defines and supports character string as objects

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
    .length, charAt, indexOf

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
    they cannot be changed

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
    javac to compile, java <package.name.filename>, from src, param1 param2
